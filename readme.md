Rag is a grotesque with an informal tone, drawn to fill a need for something broadly useful, unpretentious, vulgar, a little bit crude, and free.

The family structure is modelled on Arial, which comprises a very functional set of styles. Rag’s italic weights are slightly distinct with some different logic and flair.
