# Rag

This font was drawn on Wurundjeri Country, in the Kulin Nation. Sovereignty was never ceded.

Rag is a grotesque with an informal tone, drawn to fill a need for something broadly useful, unpretentious, vulgar, a little bit crude, and free.

The family structure is modelled on Arial, while Ragâ€™s italic weights claim their own logic and level of flair.
